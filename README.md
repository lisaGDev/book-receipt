# Book receipt

Use Python to build the application, including the Flask framework for simple web development. The application will include a database for storing cookie recipes. SQLite3 will be the database engine, and Pypyodbc will connect the database to the Python app.
The web app will enable users to view, add, modify, and delete recipes in the Cookie database.
